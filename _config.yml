description: [I am a medical anthropologist studying how diseases, environments, and borders shape one another. My work traces how Chagas disease—often framed as a tropical illness from elsewhere—reconfigures notions of health, belonging, and landscape in the United States. I am a PhD candidate in the joint Medical Anthropology program at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, advised by Charles Briggs. I am currently based at the Casa de Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro as a visiting researcher. My dissertation, At Home: Chagas Disease and the Politics of Landscape in the United States, explores how the classification of Chagas as a “foreign” disease is sustained through particular ways of seeing and inhabiting landscapes. Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork across the U.S. South, Brazil, and Colombia, I follow the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, its insect vectors, and their human and nonhuman hosts to ask how race, class, and environment intersect in the making of epidemiological borders. More broadly, my research engages with political ecology, science and technology studies, and the anthropology of health to question how “tropicality” continues to organize global hierarchies of knowledge and care. Alongside writing, I work through drawing and multimodal ethnography to explore how landscapes can be thought and felt as political units. I also collaborate with scientists, activists, and health practitioners to build interdisciplinary conversations around neglected diseases, multispecies relations, and environmental justice. I often sketch the places where I work as a way of thinking with absence, silence, and the aesthetics of disavowal.]
